Checkpoint System Implementation
Features:

Checkpoint detection: When a player touches an orange concrete block (block ID 3), 
their position is saved as a checkpoint.

Persistent storage: Checkpoints are saved using player.setPersistedData() and persist 
after the player leaves and rejoins.

Checkpoint loading: On join, the game loads the saved checkpoint position. 
If none exists, it uses the default spawn position { x: 0, y: 10, z: 0 }.
Respawn at checkpoint: When a player falls more than 50 blocks below their checkpoint, 
they respawn at their last saved checkpoint instead of the initial spawn.

User feedback: Players receive messages when:
They touch an orange concrete block: "Checkpoint saved!" (green)
They fall and respawn: "You fell off the map! Respawning at checkpoint..." (red)
They join: Instructions about checkpoints (orange)

How it works:

On join: Loads saved checkpoint from persisted data or uses default spawn

On collision: When touching orange concrete, saves current position as checkpoint

On fall: If falling too far, respawns at the last saved checkpoint

The checkpoint system is integrated with the existing fall detection system, 
so players respawn at their most recent checkpoint rather than the starting position.
